                <h1>About Me</h1> <!-- adding a little story about who I am -->
                <p>I have had an interest in photography for as long as I can remember. It used to be mostly just wanting to take pictures of sunsets and clouds, pictures of beautiful landscapes and pictures of my pets. I then got into modeling and experienced being on the other side of the camera, which I equally enjoyed and discovered another side to photography. <br>
                    <br>A few years ago, when my sister was pregnant, she asked me to take pictures for her as a maternity shoot. It wasn’t something that I was used to doing or something that had crossed my mind to do, but I told her I’d give it a shot. Well, I absolutely loved doing it and after that used her for practicing shots over and over. It is now something I do just as much as the rest of it.<br> 
                    <br>I have gone to Algonquin college to study Interactive Media Design, which included photography and videography and this is what I have been focusing most of my work on.
